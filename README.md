Cycle by Cycle (baseline PIC) Emulator 
===
(Python project)

This is a more accurate Cycle by Cycle Emulator for the (PIC16F5xx) baseline original (12-bit) architecture.

* Attempts to emulate more closely the internal working of the instruction execution pipeline
* No attempt was made at optimising the code execution
* Testing of correct instruction execution is done by using the py.test package
